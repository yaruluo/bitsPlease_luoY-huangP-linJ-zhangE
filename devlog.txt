- design doc reviewed by Team JEeBerS and Team Mykolyangelo
- JEeBerS complimented organization and layout of doc, as well as visualizations
  - suggested color-coding site map
- Mykolyangelo complimented visualizations and site map
  - suggested we moved D3 from 'backend' to 'machinery' component map
  - suggested we add dates to project timeline
  - asked for clarification on mechanism of changing display options for graphs
- in response, component map and project timeline were updated
  - site map will be updated in near future as we figure out structure of site
- thanks to new deadline, we were able to devote more time to finishing the expected product
  - also squeezed in a bit a time to work on extra features, subject to change
