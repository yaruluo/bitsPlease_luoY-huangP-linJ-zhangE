      population (column: state, pop),
      ethnicity (column: state, hispanic, white, black, native, asian, pacific),
      gender ratio (column: state, men, women),
      and voting citizen (column: state, voting, nonvoting) by state charts

      population (column: county, pop)
      and median income (column: county, income) by county charts for the given state

- design doc reviewed by Team JEeBerS and Team Mykolyangelo
- JEeBerS complimented organization and layout of doc, as well as visualizations

- thanks to new deadline, we were able to devote more time to finishing the expected product
  - also squeezed in a bit a time to work on extra features, subject to change
