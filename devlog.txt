      population (column: state, pop),
      ethnicity (column: state, hispanic, white, black, native, asian, pacific),
      gender ratio (column: state, men, women),
      and voting citizen (column: state, voting, nonvoting) by state charts

      population (column: county, pop)
      and median income (column: county, income) by county charts for the given state

- design doc reviewed by Team JEeBerS and Team Mykolyangelo
- JEeBerS complimented organization and layout of doc, as well as visualizations
  - suggested color-coding site map
- Mykolyangelo complimented visualizations and site map
  - suggested we moved D3 from 'backend' to 'machinery' component map
  - suggested we add dates to project timeline
  - asked for clarification on mechanism of changing display options for graphs
- in response, component map and project timeline were updated
  - site map will be updated in near future as we figure out structure of site
- thanks to new deadline, we were able to devote more time to finishing the expected product
  - also squeezed in a bit a time to work on extra features, subject to change

jackieL -- 2020-04-29 22:10
- edited __init__.py to contain basic routes and imports
- added in more folders and added in code for base.html and home.html files

peihuaH -- 2020-04-30 19:50
- adjusted file path is parser.py
- made basic template for states (state.html)
- linked state.html to flask route
- created the population by county chart

jackieL -- 2020-05-01 03:17
- added basic template for home (home.html)
- linked home.html to flask route
- mapped state population data in home.js

peihuaH -- 2020-05-01 20:39
- fixed population by county chart such that:
  - the bars no longer go past the edge of the page
  - the labels are displayed to the right of the bars so none of them are blocked anymore

peihuaH -- 2020-05-02 00:25
- did the ethnicity by state chart (after mulling over a lot of code ;-;)
- changed parser.py to split up getting ethnicity data through get_ethnicity_by_state() instead
  of get_data_by_state() to make it easier for the ethnicity chart (removes unnecessary columns)

peihuaH -- 2020-05-02 00:48
- changed the colors of the radial stacked bar graph for better visuals
