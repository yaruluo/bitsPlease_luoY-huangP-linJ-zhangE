# Description/summary

Our project makes use of census data compiled from 2017, sourced from Kaggle.com.
The data contains a wealth of information, from gender ratios to median income
statistics. This information will be represented in a variety of visualizations,
including bar charts, pie charts, and choropleth maps. To encourage user
interactivity, users will be able to navigate between different visualizations as
well as choose between display options.
